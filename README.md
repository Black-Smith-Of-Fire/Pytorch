# SPACEVAULT

## Overview
This project is a decentralized staking and yield farming platform built on the **Ethereum blockchain**. It allows users to stake their tokens, earn rewards, and participate in yield farming activities. The platform leverages **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

## Why Ethereum?

### **1. Smart Contract Functionality**
Ethereum enables the creation of **smart contracts**, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules. This allows us to automate staking and yield farming processes without intermediaries.

### **2. Decentralization**
Ethereum operates on a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring no single entity has control over the platform. This aligns with the principles of Web3 and blockchain technology.

### **3. Large Developer Community**
Ethereum has one of the largest and most active developer communities, providing access to a wide range of tools, libraries, and frameworks.

### **4. Established Ecosystem**
Ethereum is home to thousands of decentralized applications (DApps) and the majority of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects, making it a hub for innovation.

### **5. ERC Standards**
Ethereum’s **ERC-20** and **ERC-721** standards enable the creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ensuring interoperability with other applications and protocols.

## How We Are Using Ethereum

### **1. Staking**
- Users can stake their tokens in a smart contract to earn rewards.
- The staking contract is written in **Solidity** and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Rewards are distributed based on the staking duration and amount.

### **2. Yield Farming**
- Users can provide liquidity to DeFi protocols like **Aave** or **Uniswap** to earn additional yield.
- The platform integrates with these protocols using Ethereum smart contracts.

### **3. Token Creation**
- The platform supports the creation of custom tokens using the **ERC-20** standard.
- Users can create and manage their own tokens directly on the platform.

## Smart Wallet (Solidity)

### **Overview**
The **Smart Wallet** is a Solidity-based contract that allows users to manage their funds securely. It supports multi-signature transactions, enabling multiple parties to approve transactions before execution.

### **Key Features**
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Requires multiple approvals for critical transactions.
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized to minimize transaction costs.
- **Security**: Implements best practices to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy and overflow.

### **Implementation**
1. **Wallet Creation**:
   - Users can create a smart wallet by deploying a Solidity contract.
   - The wallet supports multiple owners and a threshold for transaction approvals.

2. **Transaction Execution**:
   - Transactions are proposed by one owner and must be approved by a specified number of owners.
   - Once the threshold is met, the transaction is executed.

3. **Gas Optimization**:
   - The contract uses efficient data structures and minimizes on-chain computations to reduce gas costs.

Example:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SmartWallet {
    address[] public owners;
    uint256 public threshold;
    mapping(uint256 => Transaction) public transactions;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public approvals;

    struct Transaction {
        address to;
        uint256 value;
        bytes data;
        bool executed;
    }

    constructor(address[] memory _owners, uint256 _threshold) {
        owners = _owners;
        threshold = _threshold;
    }

    function submitTransaction(address to, uint256 value, bytes memory data) public {
        uint256 transactionId = transactions.length;
        transactions[transactionId] = Transaction(to, value, data, false);
    }

    function approveTransaction(uint256 transactionId) public {
        require(!transactions[transactionId].executed, "Transaction already executed");
        approvals[transactionId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function executeTransaction(uint256 transactionId) public {
        require(!transactions[transactionId].executed, "Transaction already executed");
        uint256 approvalCount = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            if (approvals[transactionId][owners[i]]) {
                approvalCount++;
            }
        }
        require(approvalCount >= threshold, "Insufficient approvals");
        Transaction storage txn = transactions[transactionId];
        txn.executed = true;
        (bool success, ) = txn.to.call{value: txn.value}(txn.data);
        require(success, "Transaction failed");
    }
}
```

## Security Measures

### **1. Smart Contract Security**
- **Audits**: Regular audits using tools like **MythX** and **Slither**.
- **Best Practices**: Follow OpenZeppelin guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy and overflow.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test contracts on testnets (e.g., Goerli, Rinkeby) before deployment.

### **2. Backend Security**
- **Spring Security**: Implement authentication and authorization using **OAuth2** and **JWT**.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of APIs with rate limiting.

### **3. Frontend Security**
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Secure Storage**: Use secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data (e.g., browser localStorage with encryption).
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Why React for Frontend?

### **1. Component-Based Architecture**
- **Reusability**: React’s component-based structure allows for reusable UI components.
- **Modularity**: Components can be developed and tested independently.

### **2. Performance**
- **Virtual DOM**: Ensures efficient updates and rendering, improving performance.
- **Smooth User Experience**: Minimizes unnecessary re-renders.

### **3. Rich Ecosystem**
- **Libraries and Tools**: Access to a vast ecosystem of libraries (e.g., Redux, React Router) and tools (e.g., Create React App, Next.js).

### **4. Cross-Platform Development**
- **React Native**: React skills can be reused to build mobile applications.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: React supports building PWAs for offline functionality and native-like experiences.
